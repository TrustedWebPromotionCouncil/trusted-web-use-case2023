The numbers in the gin profiling output you provided are as follows:

Alloc: The total amount of memory that has been allocated by the Go program.
TotalAlloc: The total amount of memory that has ever been allocated by the Go program, even if it has been freed since then.
Sys: The total amount of memory that has been allocated by the Go program from the operating system.
Lookups: The number of times that the garbage collector has looked for objects in the heap.
Mallocs: The number of times that the garbage collector has allocated new objects on the heap.
Frees: The number of times that the garbage collector has freed objects from the heap.
HeapAlloc: The amount of memory that has been allocated on the heap.
HeapSys: The total amount of memory that has been allocated by the heap, including memory that is currently in use and memory that is unused.
HeapIdle: The amount of memory that is currently unused on the heap.
HeapInuse: The amount of memory that is currently in use on the heap.
HeapReleased: The amount of memory that has been freed from the heap.
HeapObjects: The number of objects that are currently on the heap.
Stack: The amount of memory that is currently being used by the stack.
MSpan: The number of memory segments that are currently in use.
MCache: The number of memory cache entries that are currently in use.
BuckHashSys: The amount of memory that is currently being used by the hash table that is used to store the memory segments.
GCSys: The amount of time that has been spent by the garbage collector.
OtherSys: The amount of time that has been spent by other system calls, such as file I/O.
NextGC: The estimated amount of time that it will be until the next garbage collection.
LastGC: The time at which the last garbage collection occurred.
PauseNs: The list of pauses that have occurred during garbage collection. Each pause is represented by a pair of numbers, the first of which is the duration of the pause in nanoseconds and the second of which is the time at which the pause occurred.
PauseEnd: The list of times at which the pauses that are listed in the PauseNs field ended.
NumGC: The number of garbage collections that have occurred.
NumForcedGC: The number of garbage collections that have been forced, such as by a call to the runtime.GC() function.
GCCPUFraction: The fraction of CPU time that has been spent by the garbage collector.
DebugGC: A boolean value that indicates whether or not the garbage collector is in debug mode.
MaxRSS: The maximum resident set size of the Go program. The resident set size is the amount of physical memory that is currently being used by the program.
